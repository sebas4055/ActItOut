# Act It Out!

**Act It Out!** is a bilingual charades-style mobile game built using SwiftUI. 
I developed it during my senior year of high school to make family game nights more inclusive for my Spanish-speaking parents.
With no formal programming education or local resources, I taught myself Swift and SwiftUI and published the app independently on the App Store, where it reached over 4,000 downloads.

## Features

- Bilingual gameplay (English and Spanish)
- Countdown timer
- Category and language selection
- Fully built with SwiftUI

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode

## Notes

- This project is no longer live on the App Store.
- All code, design, and assets were created independently.
- Some parts may use older SwiftUI syntax from 2022.

## What I’d Improve Now
This was my first-ever mobile app, and I built it before taking any formal computer science courses. I was completely self-taught—relying on YouTube tutorials, Apple documentation, and trial-and-error to get things working. That meant writing a lot of simple, repetitive code just to get the job done.

- Since then, I’ve taken university-level programming courses and learned more about code structure, abstraction, and maintainability. If I were rebuilding this app today, I would:
- Refactor repeated logic using enums, arrays, and dictionaries
- Separate the UI from the game logic using clearer architecture (e.g., MVC or MVVM)
- Improve localization support for English/Spanish switching
- Use more modular components for better scalability and readability
  
This project taught me how to solve problems with limited tools—and it gave me a foundation I’ve been building on ever since.
