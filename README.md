# Act It Out!

**Act It Out!** is a bilingual charades-style mobile game built using SwiftUI. 
I developed it during my senior year of high school to make family game nights more inclusive for my Spanish-speaking parents.
With no formal programming education or local resources, I taught myself Swift and SwiftUI and published the app independently on the App Store, where it reached over 4,000 downloads.

## Features

- Bilingual gameplay (English and Spanish)
- Countdown timer
- Category and language selection
- Fully built with SwiftUI

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode

## Notes

- This project is no longer live on the App Store.
- All code, design, and assets were created independently.
- Some parts may use older SwiftUI syntax from 2022.
